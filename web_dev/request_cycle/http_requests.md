1) Common HTTP status codes:

	100's - informational status. Going okay continue with request.

	200's - successful. Request was received understood and accepted.

	300's - more information from the user needed. URI provided isn't specific enough, 
			URI has changed, URI changed temporarily.

	400's - Error from the user. Forbidden, conflict, unauthorized, bad request, legal reasons.

	500's - server side problems. Internal server error, bad gateway, service unavailable,
			HTTP version not supported. Maintenance.


2) What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
	GET requests data from a specific resource(fetching documents). POST submits data to be processed to a specific resource(updating server forms).
	GET retrieves data and POST writes data.
