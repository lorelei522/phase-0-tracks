write the algorithm for using an elevator. Remember, robots are not smart at all, so you'll have to spell everything out.
For instance, how will your robot figure out which floor button to press?

Move forward until inside the elevator.
Locate elevator controls along the wall.
Press button to floor desired.
Until you reach floor desired:
	Remain in elevator
If floor desired reached and doors open:
	Exit the elevator
