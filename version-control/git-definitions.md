# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
	It helps track progress when you are working on code. It is helpful because it helps you know when changes have been made and keep original code safe. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch creates a copy of your work so that you can make changes without it affecting your original work. You would use one to be able to test out changes to your original code and see the results.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	Commit is when you make save points in Git. A good commit message is one that is detailed. It will let the reader know "oh they made this change or that change".
* What is a merge conflict?
	Sometimes Git will get confused when you try to merge a file where maybe the same line in the code was edited by 2 people. Git doesn't understand what to do because changes have been made maybe in the same place. That is when you as the programmer need to let it know which is right.
